# thumbnails
Simple python thumbnailer

Given a directory full of images it uses pillow to generate a 'medium' and 'thumbnail' version of all the jpegs it finds. It will not overwrite existing images and can be run many times on the same directory.

Simply 'pip install pillow', change the directory to your image location, and run from the command line.
